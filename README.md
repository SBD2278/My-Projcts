Hi there üëã
My name is SBD2278 and I'm a software developer who loves building simple programs using Python and Bash scripting.

I have experience in:

Automating everyday tasks with Python scripts
Creating command-line tools with Bash scripts
Building unit converters, file managers, password generators etc
Taking user input and executing logic and calculations
Using Python libraries like shutil, random, string etc
In my repos you'll find small scripts to demonstrate functionality and solve real-world problems. I'm always looking to learn new concepts and techniques!

Outside of coding, I enjoy reading, hiking and playing strategy games. I also volunteer at local coding meetups to share my knowledge with others.

If you found a script interesting or useful, feel free to leave a star ‚≠ê It helps me know what to build more of! You're also welcome to submit issues or PRs if you have any suggestions.

Have a nice day!

Let me know if you would like me to modify or expand this README in any way. I tried to capture an overview of your skills and interests.
